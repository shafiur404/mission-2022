        <p>
          You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          About the only constant when it comes to developing for the web is
          change. Take NodeJS, for example: two or three years ago, it didn't
          exist, and there was very little (if any) JavaScript being done on the
          server.
